# Horiseon-Site
website for Horiseon Marketing
Original coding contained a lot of redundant code. There was an unneccesary amount of "divs" and too many redundancies in the CSS file.
I found an unnessecary amount of classes in the HTML, so I replaced those with better HTML semantics such as main, section, article, etc.
I noticed in the original code, there was no alt attributes for the images or title so I went ahead and added those for accessibilty purposes. 

Here is a link to the new Horiseon Marketing Site.

I will also attach some helpful screenshots. These show the top half as well as the bottom half of the front page of the website.
